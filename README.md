Recommendations

-Since there is a decrease in sales across years, it's obvious that there is a decrease in foot traffic due to the dominance of online retailers. I recommend the owner hosts events and workshops to attract customers and also adapt to technology by creating an E-commerce platform online for online customers. This will inturn drive sales and revenue generation.

-The owners should create a software to track stock inventory to ensure that the best selling books,books with topmost reviews and books with highest ratings will always been in stock,offline and online.

-The owners should also diversify in different books like novel,E-books,journals, etc to attract customers offline and online. They should also keep up with latest market trends in best selling books in other to keep business running effectively.
